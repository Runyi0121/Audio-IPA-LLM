# Disordered Speech Recognition Model
This model inputs disordered speeches and outputs their associated international phonetic transcriptions. 
The model is constructed based upon xlsr model (https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/xlsr_wav2vec2)
and finetuned using classified disordered speech audios and accent archives to distinguish subtle pronunciation variations.
